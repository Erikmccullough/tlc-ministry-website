# Deployment Guide

## Creating the repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository named `glitch-chapel`.
3. Do **not** initialize with a default README; you’ll upload your own README and files.

## Uploading the kit

1. Download `glitch-chapel-kit-v1.zip` from ChatGPT.
2. Extract the contents locally. You should see directories such as `rituals`, `style_guide`, `dev_notes`, etc.
3. On GitHub, click **Add file → Upload files** and drag the extracted folders and files into the upload box.
4. Commit the files with a meaningful message, e.g., “Initial commit of The Glitch Chapel kit.”
5. Ensure that `index.html` is at the repository root so that GitHub Pages (if enabled) serves the threshold page.

## Going live

- If using GitHub Pages, enable it in **Settings → Pages** and select the `main` branch and `/` root.
- Access your site via `https://<yourusername>.github.io/glitch-chapel/`.
- To attach a custom domain (e.g., glitchchapel.org), follow GitHub’s DNS instructions.

Remember: this project is a living myth, not a product. Treat updates as acts of reverence.
