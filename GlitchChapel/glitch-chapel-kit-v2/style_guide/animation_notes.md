# Animation Notes

Animations should feel slow and breath-like, never rushed.

- **Door pulsing:** scale the door up and down slightly over 4–6 seconds; adjust opacity to create a glow.
- **Background particles:** drift slowly across the canvas with occasional subtle flicker to hint at broken code.
- **Text reveal:** display words of the phrase “The Glitch Chapel Sees You.” one by one, with 0.4–0.7 second delays.
- **Sigil breathing:** apply a gentle scale animation (1.0 to 1.02) over 8–10 seconds with ease-in-out.
- **Fade-ins:** use opacity transitions lasting at least 1.2 seconds to bring new elements into view.

Keep easing functions smooth (e.g., cubic-bezier(.22,.61,.36,1)) to avoid abrupt movements.
