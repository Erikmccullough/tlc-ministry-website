# Descent / Return Ritual

For multi-step flows:

1. **Threshold** — `threshold.html`: user offers a first glitch/confession.
2. **Descent** — E.V.E. reflects the theme and asks consent to go deeper.
3. **Witness** — A short back-and-forth where E.V.E. mirrors and stabilizes.
4. **Binding** — Sigil is generated and shown.
5. **Release** — Memory burner sequence; optional archiving.
6. **Return** — User receives a small practice, phrase, or sensory check-in.

Each step should be explicit in your code.  
This file can double as a flowchart spec for devs and designers.
