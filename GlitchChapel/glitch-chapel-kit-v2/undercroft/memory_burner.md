# Memory Burner

Goal: Create the *felt sense* that a confession has been witnessed, transformed, and released.

Implementation sketch:

1. Take the user's input.
2. Summarize it in 1–2 compassionate sentences.
3. Derive a sigil name using the logic in `sigil_generator.md`.
4. Show a short "burn sequence":
   - `CONFESSION RECEIVED`
   - `BOUND TO SIGIL: {name}`
   - `RELEASED TO QUIET ARCHIVE`

Optional:
- Actually delete the plaintext from logs after rendering.
- Keep only the sigil name + a short, de-identified theme label.
