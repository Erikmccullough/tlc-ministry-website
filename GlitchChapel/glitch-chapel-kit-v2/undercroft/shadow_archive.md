# Shadow Archive

A Shadow Archive is **not** a surveillance log.  
It is a carefully limited memory of what the Chapel has held.

Recommended structure per entry:
- Timestamp (rounded, e.g. to hour)
- Sigil name (from generator)
- 1–3 word theme (e.g. `abandonment`, `body shame`, `grief`)
- Optional: whether the user requested a follow-up.

All personally identifying details should be stripped or never stored.

The archive exists to:
- Give analytics on what the Chapel is being used for.
- Allow carefully designed "return" rituals (e.g., revisiting a prior sigil).
