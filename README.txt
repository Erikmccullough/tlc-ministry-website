TLC Ministry – Tacos, Love & Creation Foundation
Static Site Bundle (Release October 27, 2025)

HOW TO DEPLOY
1. Upload all files/folders from this zip to your web root (example: /public_html or the main folder your host serves).
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - site.webmanifest
   - robots.txt
   - sitemap.xml
   - /assets
   - /icons

2. DNS: tacosloveandcreation.org should point to your host via A record. www can CNAME to tacosloveandcreation.org or share the A record. SSL must cover both.

3. The header is white, nav wraps on mobile, and overflow-x is disabled to kill sideways scrolling.

4. Donate block text is horizontal now. Recurring, memberships, programs, shop, social, and tax receipts are all labeled "Coming Soon" to stay honest and compliant.

5. The hero block includes a placeholder "Intro video coming soon." Once you publish your trailer to YouTube/Vimeo, replace the placeholder div in .video-frame with the iframe embed.

LEGAL / TRANSPARENCY
- Footer states: TLC Ministry – Tacos, Love & Creation Foundation is a not-for-profit corporation registered in Oklahoma on Dec 18, 2024. 501(c)(3) status and automated tax receipts are in progress.
- This matches your state filing and protects you.

BRANDING
- Header uses assets/logo.png on a white bar so it looks intentional.
- Icons for favicon / PWA are in /icons. The <head> already references them.

After upload, you're ready to email sponsors/partners and look established.
